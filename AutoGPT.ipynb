            "\u001b[33mSYSTEM: \u001b[0m Command start_agent returned: Agent climate_change_agent created with key 1. First response: Climate change is affecting wildlife and ecosystems in various ways, including: 1. Habitat loss: As temperatures rise, habitats are changing, and some species are struggling to adapt. This can lead to habitat loss and fragmentation, which can have a significant impact on wildlife populations. 2. Changes in migration patterns: Many species rely on seasonal changes to migrate to different areas for food and breeding. However, climate change is causing these patterns to shift, which can disrupt ecosystems and lead to declines in certain species. 3. Increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters: Climate change is causing more frequent and severe natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes, and floods. These events can have devastating effects on wildlife and ecosystems. To mitigate these effects, we can take several actions, including: 1. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions: By reducing our carbon footprint, we can slow the rate of climate change and give wildlife and ecosystems more time to adapt. 2. Protecting and restoring habitats: By protecting and restoring habitats, we can provide wildlife with the resources they need to survive and thrive. 3. Supporting sustainable practices: By supporting sustainable practices, such as sustainable agriculture and forestry, we can reduce the impact of human activities on wildlife and ecosystems. 4. Promoting conservation efforts: By promoting conservation efforts, we can help protect endangered species and preserve biodiversity.\n",

Polar bears: As sea ice melts due to rising temperatures, polar bears are losing their hunting grounds and struggling to find food. This is leading to declines in their populations. 2. Coral reefs: Rising ocean temperatures and acidity levels are causing coral reefs to bleach and die off. This is having a significant impact on the many species that rely on these ecosystems for food and shelter. 3. Birds: Changes in migration patterns are affecting many bird species, such as the American robin, which is now arriving at its breeding grounds earlier than usual due to warmer temperatures. 4. Forests: Rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns are causing forests to dry out and become more susceptible to wildfires. This is having a significant impact on many species that rely on these ecosystems for food and shelter. 5. Marine life: Rising ocean temperatures are causing many species of marine life, such as fish and sea turtles, to move to new areas in search of cooler waters. This can disrupt ecosystems and lead to declines in certain species. These are just a few examples of how climate change is affecting different species and ecosystems. The impacts of climate change are complex and far-reaching, and they require urgent action to mitigate their effects.\n",
