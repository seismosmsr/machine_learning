rainfall variability \\nand intensity are increasing, sea level is rising, and \\nthe extreme events of weather such as cyclone, heat \\nwave, heavy rain, flood, and drought are becoming \\nfiercer and frequent (moefcc, 2021 ). ensuring food \\nsecurity while reducing emission of ghgs, i.e.,  co2, \\nmethane  (ch4) and nitrous oxide  (n2o), is a chal -\\nlenge for indian agriculture. as 85% of indian farm -\\ners are marginal, cultivating agricultural land less \\nthan 1\\xa0ha and small, cultivating between 1 and 2\\xa0ha; \\nthe task is more challenging (gupta & pathak, 2016 ). \\nthe poor, small-holder farmers suffer more due to \\nthe risks of climate change as they are more depend -\\nent on climate-sensitive natural resources, though \\nthey contribute least to climate change. agriculture \\nis the key sector, particularly in the developing and \\nleast developed countries, contributing to the united \\nnation’s 2030 agenda for the sustainable develop -\\nment goals (sdgs). the 17 sdgs address poverty, \\nhunger, health, hygiene, climate, and resource con -\\nsumption to ensure global economic, social and envi -\\nronmental well-being. agriculture is interdependently \\nand multidimensionally connected to the sdgs, which \\ncan be both synergistic and antagonistic (ladha et\\xa0al., \\n2020 ). globally agriculture is the main sector for food \\nproduction. however, agriculture and other land use \\nchanges (afolu) accounts for up to 24% of the ghg \\nemission from about 22.2 million  km2 of agricultural \\narea. enhancing climate resilience of agriculture is \\ntherefore crucial for achieving the sdgs, particularly \\ngoal no. 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger) and 13 (cli -\\nmate action). this paper assesses the impacts of cli -\\nmate change on indian agriculture, analyzes the vari -\\nous options for adaptation and mitigation, and enlists \\nthe initiatives taken by the govt. of india in address -\\ning the emerging challenges of climate change.\\nimpacts of\\xa0climate change on\\xa0indian agriculture\\nindia has a wide range of climatic conditions with \\nextreme winters in the north and tropical conditions in the \\nsouth (lal & ahmad, 2016 ). the north-eastern regions \\nof the country are hot and humid whereas dry and arid \\nconditions are in the north-western regions. rainfall dur -\\ning june to september (southwest monsoon season) is  the primary determinant of agricultural yields in india \\n(mohapatra et\\xa0al., 2022 ). extreme weather events (flood, \\ndrought, heat and cold waves, flash flood, cyclone, and \\nhail-storms) very severely affect agricultural production \\n(aggarwal et\\xa0al., 2021 ).\\nthe  6th assessment report of ipcc reaffirmed that \\nclimate change can affect agriculture with wide conse -\\nquences (ipcc, 2021 ). increase in atmospheric tem -\\nperature can have direct impacts in reducing crop dura -\\ntion, photosynthesis, and ultimately crop yield. it can \\naffect the survival and distributions of pest populations, \\nincrease soil nutrient mineralization, decrease nutri -\\nent use efficiency, and increase water loss resulting in \\nincreasing demand of irrigation water and plant nutri -\\nents. climate change has significant indirect effects on \\nagriculture with its effects on irrigation water availabil -\\nity, droughts and floods, soil fertility and erosion.\\nclimate affects all the plant processes including pho -\\ntosynthesis, respiration, water relations, nutrient uptake, \\nand phenology affecting crop yield and quality. the \\nmajor risk-prone crops with reduced productivity are rice \\nand wheat in the indo-gangetic plains (igp) and maize \\nin the mid-igp and southern plateau. it is estimated that \\ncrop yield in india will be reduced due to climate change \\nby 4.5–9.0% (naresh kumar et\\xa0al., 2020 ). as agriculture \\ncurrently contributes about 17% of the country’s gdp, \\nclimate change will cost to gdp by about 1.0% from \\ncrop sector alone. ironically, poor farmers are especially \\nvulnerable due to climate change and they are more \\ndependent on climate-sensitive resources, though they \\ncontribute the least to climate change. a summary of \\nvarious physical, spatial, and socio-economic impacts of \\nclimate change has been presented in table\\xa0 1. assessed \\n(1960–2010) and projected (2040–2069) climate change \\nvulnerability of indian agriculture are presented in fig.\\xa0 1.\\nclimate change and crop productivity\\nclimate change due to elevated level of carbon dioxide \\nconcentration in the atmosphere is likely to compensate \\nthe negative effects of increased temperature on yields. \\nhowever, further increase in temperature would result \\nin yield losses. a net reduction in yield of crops with \\nclimate change has been projected, if no adaptation is \\nfollowed (table\\xa0 2). projections indicate losses of yield \\nranging from 9% in wheat to 18% in kharif maize by \\n2040 with the representative concentration pathways \\n(rcp) 4.5 scenario (naresh kumar et\\xa0al., 2019 , 2020 ). \\nthe representative concentration pathways, adopted environ monit assess (2023) 195:52  52   page 2 of 22\\n']"
